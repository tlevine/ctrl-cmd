ctrl-cmd
======
`ctrl-cmd` is like the standard Windows `CMD.EXE` but with three missing features:

1. `C^c` copies
2. `C^v` pastes
3. Multi-line selections select linearly with the text rather than rectangularly
    with the screen.

It is a modified version of the `CMD.EXE` from [ReactOS](http://www.reactos.org)
